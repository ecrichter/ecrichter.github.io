Increasingly, technology companies are applying data analysis techniques to the vast volumes of data generated by "smart" devices ranging from phones, to applicances, vehicles, and more. This regression project centers on smart energy usage using measurements electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 year. The data set description can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
